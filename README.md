## 💡 About Me  

Hey! I’m passionate about **cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and web application security**.  
I love exploring vulnerabilities, testing systems, and learning how to protect them from real-world attacks.  

🔭 Currently focused on:  
- Web App & API Penetration Testing  
- Bug Bounty Hunting & Vulnerability Research  
- Linux, Networking, and Cybersecurity Fundamentals  
- Building small tools & scripts to automate security testing  

I believe in **learning by doing** — and I’m always practicing on platforms like **TryHackMe**, **HackTheBox**, and **CTF challenges**.
